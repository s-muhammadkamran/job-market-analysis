## Web Driver
---

A Seleneium WebDriver software would be required to run the web scraping examples. I used a Google Chrome Web Driver. Do the following steps:

1. Note down your OS and platform for example in my case it was Windows X64.
2. Note down the Chrome Browser Version, for example in my case is was 127.0.6533.120.
3. Based on the above details download the WebDriver from below URL. \
   3.1. [https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/127.0.6533.120/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip]
4. After downloading save the WebDriver in the Drivers folder of the ipynb file location.
