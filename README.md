##### Web Driver

A Seleneium WebDriver software would be required to run the web scraping examples. I used a Google Chrome Web Driver. Do the following steps:

*. Note down your OS and platform for example in my case it was Windows X64.
*. Note down the Chrome Browser Version, for example in my case is was 127.0.6533.120.
*. Based on the above details download the WebDriver from below URL.
   *. [https://storage.googleapis.com/chrome-for-testing-public/127.0.6533.120/win64/chromedriver-win64.zip]
*. After downloading save the WebDriver in the Drivers folder of the ipynb file location.
